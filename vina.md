# AutoDock Vina: Tips and Tricks for faster processing

AutoDock Vina is a very popoular program to perform protein-ligand docking. A large number of GUIs and extensions have been created by many people to make it easier to use Vina, yet somehow I still always prefer the out-of-box version of vina as it is for providing full control over your experiments and allowing you to customize your process.

There are literally so many ways, that someone wrote a paper titled **"1001 Ways to run AutoDock Vina for virtual screening"** [Jaghoori et al, 2016]("https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10822-016-9900-9").
